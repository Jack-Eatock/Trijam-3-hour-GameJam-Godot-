[3 Hours development time with the theme: "Underneath Us"]

Made in 3 Hours using Godot 4 and   GDScript for the  Trijam #260 Game Jam!. This is my first time using both Godot and GDScript. It was   stressful, to say the least xD

Description:

Guide a swarm of Bloblets through danger and return them to their queen. 

Controls:

WASD  or Arrow Keys - Move swarm of bloblets
R - Restart level
References:

All assets, dev, music and art I  created within the 3 hours except one pop sound referenced below:

Twists:

Corrupted my scenes right at the end! Turned out I had created an infinite loop which kept trying to pre-load the next scene.  I went 5 mins over the 3 hours fixing the corruption,  hope that's alright. 
A timelapse video on way :)
